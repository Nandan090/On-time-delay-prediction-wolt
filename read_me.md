# 📦 On-Time Delay Prediction for Wolt

A **machine learning project** to analyze delivery orders from the Wolt platform and build models that **predict whether a delivery will be on time or delayed**.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`FINAL_WOLT.ipynb`) that walks through the full workflow — from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Understand patterns in Wolt delivery data.
- Engineer features relevant for delivery time prediction.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to forecast on-time vs delayed deliveries.
- Provide insights that could help optimize logistics and improve delivery estimates.

## 🧠 Motivation

Accurate prediction of delivery delays can help:

- Increase customer satisfaction by improving delivery estimates.
- Improve operational planning for couriers and dispatch systems.
- Reduce late deliveries and associated costs.
